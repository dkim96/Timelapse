# Timelapse

Timelapse is a personal project that works to revitalize the way we view social networking.

The basis of the application comes down to visualizing our content in accordance to where we are with a map.

Over time, the friends that we used to have will spread out across the world and the goal of this application is to visualize the way our friends impact the world around us.
