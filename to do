Design aspects: color coded pins, fixed zoom in patterns, hold to show multi pin view.


Multipin view:
select, fixed view, remove scrolling
deselect by clicking outside, remove view, enable scrolling


(ADV)Recognize Colliding Annotations
Given a set of pins, determine whether there exists a group within a specific span.

straight forward double for loop, every combination
if(distance between two locations < span/10) // colliding!

Grouped Pins: if pins are close enough together, replace them with a numbered pin, and show multi image view

If pins are grouped -> create a new pin group taking the average location, remove both pins and put in this new pin to the for loop.

New Pin: Bubbles and newLocation

isColliding sorted groups // only when span changes!!!
- (... hmm technically you might not have to remove)
- remove pins in groups and replace them with grouped pins
- keep track of removed pins to read later on



(ADV)Long Pressing an Annotation: Technology nonexistant
If a bubble was long pressed,
    examine the position of that bubble
        print the item a few positions above it
when the bubble is let go
    remove contents.

later: examining space for colliding bubbles and printing it on the long press

// UILPGR- long press for action
let uilpgr = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(action))
uilpgr.minimumPressDuration = 0.5
mapView.addGestureRecognizer(uilpgr)

mapView didSelect, didDeselect
S- tap, press, init
D- when another annot is tapped, or manually selected
